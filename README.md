# Python Course Code

This repo contains the code for Python Course that I take for NWPU students.

This ReadMe describes how to use the code.

## Instructions

In the beginning, I assume you are running your code on Windows 10 or 11 Platform.

1. You are required to setup Python environment with version 3.8 or higher. I recommend miniconda package
   from https://repo.anaconda.com/miniconda/Miniconda3-py38_4.12.0-Windows-x86_64.exe

2. After you have installed Python. Your terminal is assumed to have python and pip in Path environment variable.

3. Clone this repo by

```git clone https://github.com/ainrichman/PythonCourseCode-NWPU```

4. Enter the cloned repo in your local disk. Then you will need to install necessary python packages by:

```pip install -r requirements.txt```

5. Install Google Chrome explorer. View the version of your Chrome for example :106.0.5249.119.

6. Download Chrome driver corresponding to your Chrome version from `https://chromedriver.chromium.org/downloads` .

7. If you have issues with step 5 and 6. I prepared the Chrome offline installer and Chrome Driver in this repo in the
   folder ‘/chrome’.

8. Copy the Chrome driver to the folder `/crawler` and `/test` of this repo. 

9. (Optional) I strongly recommend you use Jetbrains' Python Development IDE Pycharm
   from `https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/`. You can run Pycharm and import this repo. Then you will be able to run the examples of this repo directly by Pycharm.

If you have other issues with the instructions above. Please contact with me.
